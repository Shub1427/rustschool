/**
 * Why Ownership:
 *
 * Low Level Programming interacts with Hardware Memory Directly.
 * Dyanamic Memory Management (Allocation/Deallocation) on Heap are difficult
 * to manage, when a program's codebase grows.
 * Rust Provides Ownership Rules to overcome these possible runtime memory leaks...
 *
 * Ownership Rules:
 *  - Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
 *  - There can only be one owner at a time.
 *  - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
 *
 * Possible Memory issues that a user faces while development, could be:
 *  - Memory Leak: when a Memory is allocated, but developer forgets to de-allocate it.
 *  - Double Free Corruption: when there are two pointers, pointing to the same memory and tries
 *      to de-allocate the same memory twice.
 *  - Dangling Pointer (References): when a pointer still points to a memory, that either is given
 *      to someone else, or is freed.
 *
 * Ownership works only for Data Types that dynamically allocates memory from Heap...
