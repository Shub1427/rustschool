# Packages, Crates and Modules

## Package

Well this topic cannot have an example, as it's a concept. Package is Rust project
created by cargo, that contains zero or one library crates and as many binary crates as anyone likes.
There must be at least one crate (either a library or a binary) in a package.

## Crate

Crate can be either the projects binary (that contains main function), or libraries that
expose APIs...

## What this Project will demonstrate

- Demonstrates different ways to create `modules`.
- Demonstrates different ways to use `use` imports.
- Illogical stuffs that test in what kinds of ways a developer might break Rust Code.
