# Algorithms in Rust

This dsa code implementation is inspired from [TheAlgorithms in Rust](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Rust)
and [TheAlgorithms in Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python). I wanted to contribute there,
but nobody accepted my PR. So this repo will solely be maintained by me and all code implementations
for DSA here, will be written from scratch.

> NOTE: These implementations are just for learning purposes, and might not be very efficient, compared to
> various better implementations out there. I am a beginner in Rust language as well. So, I am not
> expecting myself to write very good, optimized code here.

Will be happy for anybody else contributions as well!
