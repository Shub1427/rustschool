# RUSTSCHOOL :books:

Code Samples for varius Rust Features to get a heads on Rust-Lang, based on [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
It is considered:

- That you have some knowledge in programming, and have worked with some language before...
  - Best is if you have worked with some kind of OO Language (like Java) and also Functional language (like Javascript)
    as Rust uses many mixed concepts from both OOP and Functional Programming.
- That you have read [Chap-1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) from the Rust Book, for initial setups.

## Rust Book with Examples:

- **[Chap-2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)**: _Guessing Game_ [[source](./guessing-game)]
  - Helps you understand basic terms for Rust Lang.
- **[Chap-4](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)**: _Ownership_ [[source](./ownership)]
  - Helps you understand Scope and Ownership terms in Rust.
- **[Chap-5](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html)**: _Structs_ [[source](./structs)]
  - Helps you understand using Structs and what Structure Related Data is.
- **[Chap-6](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html)**: _Enums_ [[source](./enums)]
  - Basics on Enums and Match Expression used for Enums...
- **[Chap-7](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-packages-crates-and-modules.html)**: _What Happens If_[[source](./what-happens-if)]
  - Well this chapter gives breakdowns on Packages, Crates from the Book
  - Also, to make things interesting, whatever doubts I have regarding various ways of Rust will go in here.
    So If you have a doubt like _What happens if Vector is not given a type and data is pushed somewhere else_, note it down in this chapter or open a PR.

## TODO

- Add Code Samples for Embedded Programming:
