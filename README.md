Rustschool is intented for personal use and reference. It was built to maintain Rust Code
that I will be working on to learn and reference later.

Rustschool is divided into different sections of learning:

## [Rust Book](./rust-book):
  It involves code implementations for [Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

## [What Happens If](./what-happens-if):
  There are cases where Rust can get confusing. We can use the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
  to understand some nitty-gritty concepts of rust. But, here I have maintained it in repo for
  later references.

## [Exercism](./exercism):
  [Exercism Website](https://exercism.io/) is a great tool for Code practice and mentorship for everyone. This
  folder will contain code implementations for all my exercism exercises.

## [Data Structures and Algorithms](./dsa):
  My self (naive) implementatons to learn and improve my understanding for DSA, using Rust.

## [Cracking the Coding Interview](./crack-coding):
  My implementations for questions in [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](cracking-interview-book).

## [GUI](./gui):
  Implementations using:
    * Azul (for GUI)
    * Piston (for Gaming)
    * GGez (for Gaming)
  For now I am focusing only on GGez for game development, which interests me a lot.
