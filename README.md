Rustschool is intented for personal use and reference. It was built to maintain Rust Code
that I will be working on to learn and reference later.

Rustschool is divided into different sections of learning:

* [Rust Book](1):
  It involves code implementations for [Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
* [What Happens If](2):
  There are cases where Rust can get confusing. We can use the [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
  to understand some nitty-gritty concepts of rust. But, here I have maintained it in repo for
  later references.
* [Exercism](3):
  [Exercism Website](https://exercism.io/) is a great tool for Code practice and mentorship for everyone. This
  folder will contain code implementations for all my exercism exercises.
* [Data Structures and Algorithms](4):
  My self (naive) implementatons to learn and improve my understanding for DSA, using Rust.
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](5):
  My implementations for questions in [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](cracking-interview-book).
* [GUI](6):
  Implementations using Azul library to understand how azul works and what things we can do to learn building GUI.
  I am hoping to help and support `azul` by contributing to azul source code (someday)/.
